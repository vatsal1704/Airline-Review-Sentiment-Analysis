# ✈️ Airline Review Sentiment Analysis

This project analyzes airline-related tweets to determine the **sentiment** behind each post — whether it's **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, the model offers insights into public perception of airline services based on real-time Twitter data.

## 🧠 What It's About

The core goal is to process and classify tweets related to major airlines using sentiment analysis techniques. The dataset used includes real tweets from airline passengers, labeled with sentiment tags. This allows for training and evaluating a model that can automatically detect how travelers feel about their flying experience.

### 🔑 Key Features
- Dataset based on Twitter airline reviews  
- NLP preprocessing (tokenization, cleaning, stopword removal)  
- Sentiment classification using machine learning models  
- Interactive web app for testing custom tweet input  
- Real-time sentiment prediction output

## 📝 Project Description
This web-based application processes and analyzes textual reviews submitted by airline passengers. Using NLP techniques and a trained machine learning model, the system classifies each review into one of three sentiment categories: **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative**.



This project is ideal for understanding customer sentiment in the aviation industry and can be extended to other domains with similar social media-based feedback.
